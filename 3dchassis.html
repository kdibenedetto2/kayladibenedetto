                                            <p><br>For our first chassis design, we got to return to a type of manufacturing we are more familiar with: 3D printing! To work for this project, our chassis must meet several requirements including: <br> <br> 1. Wheels to move <br> 2. Sensors to see the ground<br>3. To see the LEDs<br> 4. To change the batteries <br> 5. To press the power button <br><br> Starting with some measurements of the chassis' dimensions using calipers, we measured them to be 104*72*56 mm. However, reading the instruction manual told us that they are actually 104*72*55 mm. Using these measurements, we moved onto designing our chassis in Fusion. <p/>

                                            <p><br>In our collaborative workspace in Fusion, we began designing our chassis. At first, this felt like a near impossible task and I personally felt confused and frustrated by it. Then, Sam figured out something wonderful! It turns out, you can overlay images into Fusion, and use them to shape the dimensions of your design. Once this was established, we imported a picture of the car circuit shown below (left) into our Fusion space. Using this image, we created an outline of our design. We incoporated the known height, width, and depth (measured, then verified with instruction manual), producing our chassis design, shown in the image below (right) For now, we did not incorporate a way to reach the battery, press the power button, or see the LEDs, as we just wanted an idea of whether our design would fit before fine-tuning it. <p/>

This is because we originally offset the thickness of our chassis inwards, which made the enclosure too small for our car. To amend this, and try to get a chassis that fit properly, we offsetted the thickness outwards. After this print is fulfilled and we ensure that the dimensions are correct, we will move on to adjusting the aesthetics of our design and adding to it. <p/>

The progression, including our initial print, is shown below (left). In his first redo, Sam offset the thickness outwards to get the chassis to fit. Once he got the basic dimensions down, he added 2 semi-circle cuts at the bottom for the wheels. In the next iteration, he made sure the power button was accessible. This iteration is shown below (right). At this point, we've satisfied all of the requirements for the 3D printed chassis, other than providing access to the battery and allowing the LED lights to be shown. <p/>

I would call this print somewhat successful. It definitely is not perfect by any means, but you can definitely see the vision. Some areas that need some workshopping are the rafts/supports, as all four of the cat’s feet and the tail broke off from the print. Speaking of the cat’s tail, it seems like it may have undergone a layer shift, as it is not one cohesive component, rather segmented in different sections. Additionally, there is a great amount of stringing on the sides and top of the print. Finally, while this is a nonessential detail, the print is also a little small, and I think it would look better if it had larger dimensions. <p/>

                                            <p><br>In conclusion, TinkerCad is a very user-friendly CAD tool that got the job done. Going forward and using Fusion for my next print, I want to improve on my current design, as I remix it in Fusion then set it up on PrusaSlicer. My main goals include making sure the feet and tail of the cat remain attached to the rest of the print by adding a full raft and more support for the tail, as well as increasing the size of the overall print by altering its dimensions. These changes will occur in PrusaSlicer, so for Fusion, I will just need to get used to operating the software. Feel free to check out how my Fusion print went back in the Intro to Computer Aided Design tab! <p/>
