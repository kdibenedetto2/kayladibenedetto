                                            <p><br> Upon creating a group with the shared goal of creating an accessible and useful tactile map of campus, we were all so excited and felt ready to get started with the design process! However, none of us have a visual impairment, and thus, we lack the insight into the experience of our targetted users. Before we got started on prototyping our project's design, we had to get in contact with potential users. We reached out to four seperate individuals who could give us a better sense of how to make our product the most beneficial to those who would use it. <br> <br> Our first interviewee is Elizabeth Nako. Elizabeth is the Senior Accessibility Specialist at Brandeis. She works directly with visually impaired students and is involved in their adjustment to campus. <br> <br> Our second interviewee is Elana Regan. She is a visually impaired student on campus who works with SAS. <br> <br> Our third interviewee is Nancy Sharon, who is the Director of Education and Child Services at Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton, MA. She works with both educators and students directly to enhance the experiences of students with visual impairments. <br> <br> Finally, our fourth interview took place with Marcy Waring, another visually impaired student at Brandeis. She is an SAS fellow and involved in disability justice on campus. From each of these interviews, we were able to produce both empathy and journey maps, displayed below. <p/>

                                            <p><br>From our three themes that we identified (Tactile Features & Sensory Elements, Navigation & Movement, and Fixed Reference Points), we moved onto creating insight statements. Insight statements highlight the most salient aspects of each theme and guide the framework for our "How might we..." questions that we tackle later. Our "How might we..." questions orient the information we have in a way that can more easily lead to feasible solutions. Our insight statements and "How might we..." questions are shown below: <br> <br> <b>Tactile Features & Sensory Elements <br> <br> INSIGHT STATEMENT: </b> People with visual impairments feel more confident navigating spaces when they can rely on landmarks, multiple sensory cues, and high contrast to interpret their surroundings. People with visual impairments can more effectively use maps with salient information and clear labeling (i.e texture variation, color contrast, braille, symbols etc). <br> <br><b> Q: </b> How might we point out the most salient features of the Brandeis campus in a way that makes use of clear labeling, high contrast, and texture variation in our design? <br> <br> Some ideas: Different fabrics will be incorporated to create more variety of textures. Also using textures generated with 3D printing, adding elevated blocks to indicate stairs, focusing on academic buildings and support centers rather than other infrastructure like housing/athletics facility, and using multiple labeling systems could be good protocols <br> <br> <b>Navigation & Movement <br> <br> INSIGHT STATEMENT: </b>People with visual impairments feel more confident navigating areas that are more flat/consistent elevation and have fewer interruptions (i.e., stone blocks). <br> <br><b> Q: </b>How might we improve the ability for people to navigate the Brandeis campus, especially those with visual impairments, so that everyone is on an equitable plane when moving around? <br> <br> Some ideas: Create these maps with distinct textures and place them around campus. They should make it easy for members of the Brandeis community to tell where they are. We could also make smaller maps with portions of the campus that can be carried by the student with them (instead of just the stationary map). <br><br> <b> Fixed Reference Points <br> <br>INSIGHT STATEMENT: </b>People with visual impairments rely on landmarks, entrances, and other stationary/permanent features as points of orienting themselves (especially in large or open spaces where pathways could be less distinct). <br> <br> <b> Q: </b> How might we incorporate landmarks and indicate entrances of buildings into our overall design? <br> <br> Some ideas: We could use a different texture on the buildings to include the most accessible entrance or indicating it in braille/with a symbol. We could also add a “you are here” symbol <p/>

                                            <p><br>After considering the problem and our users, we determined that creating a master map to be put on campus would be our best solution. Incorporating the feedback we recieved from our interviewees, this map would focus on academic buildings, make use of high visual/texture contrast, and clearly identify the entrances of buildings. We plan to utilize both 3D printing and laser cutting, as well as some added materials for texture, to make this happen. We created a storyboard (shown below) to visualize how a potential user would interact with our product. It documents their journey from being accepting into Brandeis, to feeling overwhelmed about navigating campus with a visual impairment, to making use of our tactile map to make their experience better and ease their sense of being overwhelmed! <p/>

The article details work in Europe that utilizes symbology keys and explains issues of customization and being able to zoom in on specific areas. This article is a good starting point to examine aspects of creating tactile maps and what we might want to include/ learn from them. <br> <br> <b>Pahaoja, Samuli. “Tactile Maps Easily | Touch Mapper.” Touch Mapper - Tactile Maps for the Visually Impaired. Accessed March 25, 2025. https://touch-mapper.org/. </b> <br> <br> This source creates .stl tactile maps by entering an address and selecting a print size and scale of the map. Although we could simply create a tactile map from this webpage, that takes all the fun away from designing a tactile map, and since it makes maps in squares, we would either have to make way too many mini maps or one map that included areas outside of campus, such as the Cedarwood neighborhood. Nonetheless, this source could be a great reference for making our final .stl map. <br> <br> <b>TomTom. “Tactile Mapping: Helping the Blind Find Their Way | TomTom Newsroom.” Accessed March 25, 2025. https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/explainers-and-insights/tactile-mapping-helping-the-blind-find-their-way/. </b><br> <br> This source provides a solid framework for defining what a tactile map is and why tactile maps are necessary societal tools. It goes into the history of tactile maps, detailing when they were first created in the 1800s and how they evolved as time went on. It debunks the suggestion that tactile maps are of no use to those who are visually impaired. It also asserts that everyone, even those with no visual impairment, should use tactile maps to enhance their understanding of the world around them.<p/>
