                                            <p><br>After moving on from TinkerCad and starting up with Fusion, several noticeable differences between the CAD tools made themselves clear. Off the bat, I could see that Fusion provides a much more detailed design layout than TinkerCad. It also introduces us to the concept of “mesh bodies” which designates the overall geometry of objects in terms of triangles. Another noticeable difference between Fusion and TinkerCad is that the plate grids had visible measurements with units while TinkerCad’s are unitless. In addition, while it was manageable to navigate TinkerCad using just the touchpad on my laptop, I had to grab a classroom mouse when operating Fusion 360, as it was nearly impossible without one.  <p/>

                                            <p><br>For my second print, I was again using the cat and bird design from the previous print, but hoping to optimize its design.One way I was hoping to change it was to make it bigger. I estimated that scaling the design up by about 4 times of its original size would produce a print I would be happy with. Pictures of both the design process and new measurements that I was planning are shown to the right. The original measurements were taken from the object manipulation section of PrusaSlicer for the previous print. <p/>

                                            <p><br>The design process in Fusion was definitely longer than that in TinkerCad. I ended up spending a considerably long amount of time trying to scale the mesh body and being unable to. For some reason, I was unable to select the mesh body, whether it be the cat (pictured to the right) or the bird. Ultimately, with Professor Ben’s help, I was able to finally do it. It turns out the way the STL file was imported into Fusion determined whether you could scale it or not; you had to import it into a new window rather than one that was already in use. In my opinion, this way of scaling was much less straightforward and needlessly difficult than the intuitive method of scaling worked in TinkerCad. However, compared with TinkerCad, the design in Fusion is definitely more visibly detailed, which will come into play with more elaborate designs.  <p/>

By changing its z axis alignment, I was able to place the bird on top of the cat and combine the 2 designs (shown to the right). After I found the design to be satisfactory, I exported the design into a 3MF file for the finishing touches on PrusaSlicer.<p/>

                                            <p><br>As I discussed in my TinkerCad page, the main issue from the previous print was that the cat’s feet and tail didn’t stick to the rest of the print once it was complete. To solve this issue, I made the ramp even more expansive and increased the supports on the tail so that there was a support making contact with the plate for the ENTIRE tail, not just on the bottom of it like in the previous print. Additionally, to make the print larger, I only doubled the X,Y, and Z dimensions of the print rather than increasing them by a multitude of 4, as I realized that the printer would not be able to produce such a large print. However, instead of scaling up the original print by a factor of 2 in the y-direction, I ended up doing a little bit more than that in order to maximize the amount of print would be on the steel plate, and try a design that was a little longer. The printing setup in PrusaSlicer is shown to the right. <p/>

I would call this print a definite success! I was able to produce a print that maintained the integrity of the cat’s feet and tail, and that was an appropriate size. I am very happy with this print in terms of its geometry as well as the color I used for this print, which is a sleek and sheen blue. Like in the print before, there is some stringing but definitely not as much. This stringing was mainly contained between the back legs of the cat (pictured at the bottom).  <p/>

                                            <p><br>In conclusion, my second print was definitely a lot better than the original! The raft that connected the entirety of the bottom was definitely the right choice, as the feet and tail managed to stay connected to the rest of the print. <br><br>While not a huge deal, I would try to avoid the bit of stringing in between the back legs of the cat in future designs, perhaps through adjusting the temperature of the extruder to be slightly cooler. Additionally, while they proved successful, the tail supports were very hard to get off and seemed a tiny bit overkill, so maybe I would find a happy medium for supporting the tail. <br><br>As of right now, I am still anti-Fusion, but I foresee my stance changing as I spend more time on the CAD tool. I am looking forward to my next print and can’t wait to continue learning!  <p/>
