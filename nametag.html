                                            <p><br>     To work with the Prusa Mini + printers, we use a software called PrusaSlicer. This software allows us to export print files (G-code) to our 3D printers. It gives us a preview of our print, and grants us the ability to make changes to the measurements, calibrations, and to add supports (shown to the right).<br><br>     We imported the design of our first print, a personalized name tag, into the Prusa Slicer application in the form of a 3mf file. On the right hand side of the screen using the print settings, we were able to edit the text on the design to say our first and last names. Once we did so, we then exported the design as G-code onto a flashdrive, which we then inserted into our 3D printer of choice.<p/>

                                            <p><br>     After downloading the G-Code, it was time to load up our printers! The first step in doing so was selecting the PLA filament for the base of the namecard. For mine, I selected the red filament. To load the filament, we had to cut the end of it into an angle and then push it through the transparent plastic tube. The wheel turned and more filament was loaded, until it was full (shown to the right). Once all of the filament was loaded, the screen on the printer asked the user to confirm that it was the right color, as the user could select yes or no while it ejected a small amount of filament. <br><br>      As I watched the printing process begin, I noted that everyone’s prints had an identical oval shape with 3 holes in the middle of it. Also like we were told, I noticed that the printing did occur slice by slice. Once the base was completed, the printer prompted us to change the filament. I ejected the red filament and selected brown for the rest of my print. At this point, I had some trouble loading it, and kept clicking “more” on the screen to get the brown filament to push through. Ultimately, I had to restart this process because the end of the brown filament was too blunt. This showed me the importance of ensuring there is an angled end to the filament before loading it into a 3D printer. <p/>

                                            <p><br>     After about 20 total minutes, our prints were complete. My finished product was a red name tag with brown lettering. I ended up really liking this color combo. To remove my name tag from the steel sheet, I scraped it off using what looked somewhat like a putty knife. The steel sheet was warm to the touch and could be removed from where it was attached magnetically. I am very happy with my first ever 3D print! :)  <p/>
