                                            <p><br>Before jumping into the robot construction, we needed to first read the instruction manual in full. While Sam has experience soldering, neither Ethan nor I did, so this part was very important to understand what we were doing. Additionally, since there were a limited number of robot kits for everyone, it was not guaranteed that we’d be able to have a replacement piece available if we did make a mistake. Also, undoing the soldering process can be pretty difficult on its own accord. Thus, we simply began with the instruction manual, provided below.  <p/>

                                            <p><br>If you don't feel like reading the entire instruction manual like we did, then no worries! Here is my overview of it. <br> <br> <b> ANTICIPATED CHALLENGES </b> <br> <br> After reading the instruction manual, one challenge that I expect to come up is trying to differentiate among the different colored stripes painted on the resistors. Shown in Step 1 on page 5 of the instructions, the resistors vary by the stripes painted on them. However, it is a little difficult to tell them apart in the enlarged picture, so the tiny pieces in real life will likely be even harder. Another challenge I anticipate facing is trying to solder on two pieces that are close together. On the circuit board, it is very important to not solder two pieces together from neighboring pieces/pads, as this will likely render the circuit board inoperable. Finally, a third challenge for me will be paying close attention to where certain wires need to be soldered. For example, the LED lights and the capacitors not only need to be inserted at a specific location, but also must be inserted in a specific orientation on the pads, due to having a positive and negative pole. Making sure that this is achieved will likely prove to be a challenge for me. <br> <br> <b> STRENGTHS </b> <br> <br> Overall, I thought this instruction manual was very comprehensive and a helpful guide that we could follow closely to make our robotic cars. One of its strengths is that rather than being general in its instructions, the manual goes step by step to guide users to their creations. This is very helpful, especially when diagnosing a problem, you can identify exactly where you went wrong. Another strength is that it includes many pictures to follow along with, and many of these pictures include sections that are zoomed in or circled in order to effectively direct the user's attention. Finally, the schematic diagram of the car shown on page 2 is helpful for those trying to learn or who are already familiar with how electricity and circuits work. <br> <br> <b> WEAKNESSES </b> <br> <br> While the instruction manual had many strengths going for it, it also had some notable weaknesses. For one, I found the introduction on page 1 to be a bit complex and hard to read. For example, the sentence “If the detection is black runway, then the car to change the direction of driving and motor will slow down or even stop and Red LED OFF on PCB front side” to be difficult to understand. I had to reread it a few times, until I understand what it was aiming to say. I think that if this sentence was rewritten, the instructions would become a little bit more understandable. I think another aspect that the manual could improve upon is adding an explanation of the role of each component as it is added to the circuit. This would allow the user can understand why they are doing what they are instructed to do if they are a beginner and may not necessarily know. It could be helpful to explain exactly what each piece does in the circuit, as well as why it is a necessary part of the car. Some final changes I would propose to the writers of the instruction manual is to reiterate over some information that they only introduced once. For example, I would suggest reitering over which pad the positive goes on and which pad the negative goes on each time a polar component is installed; although initially mentioned on page 8 when discussing the red LEDs, it would also be helpful on page 11, when installing the white LEDs is instructed. <p/>

                                            <p><br>After reading the instruction manual, it was time to get to work! We decided to each make our own car, so that we would maximize our chances of producing one that worked. Initially, Ethan and I worked on one car together because we both had no prior experience with soldering, while Sam was pretty confident, so he dived in nose first.  After installing all of the resistors on my car, Ethan and I sadly decided it was best to part ways, since we both felt more comfortable soldering and wanted to try to use our time efficiently. <br> As I continued on with the circuit on my own, I worked at a slow, but steady pace. One important part of soldering that I learned was that the tip of the soldering iron should nearly always be a shiny silver color (left). To achieve this, I would frequently clean the tip on soldering wool. However, at times the iron would get so discolored that it required more than just the soldering wool. At this point, I would use the tip tinner (right), which would re-tin the soldering iron with more powerful chemistry than the soldering wool. <p/>

For instance, once I started soldering the photoresistors (which are on a different side of the circuit as any of the previously soldered components), it became very hard to keep the board balanced and solder at the same time. With this, I welcomed some Helping Hands! (shown to the right). From then on, I made use of these and never looked back. <p/>

                                            <p><br> After all 3 of us finished constructing our cars, we found that my car ended up working the best. While mine was able to follow the track outside the engineering room (shown in the video to the right), Ethan and Sam had less luck, and found their car doing donuts instead. They had the same issue; their capacitors were not soldered on correctly, which prevented the white LEDs from functioning, resulting in their cars’ inability to distinguish between the light and dark contrast. <p/>

                                            <p><br> However, one way that this car didn't work ideally is how it had trouble when met the gray tile. When it crossed this tile, it would end up doing donuts (shown to the right). This occurred because the sensors on the car was unable to differentiate between black and white on the gray tile (it is a <b>literal</b> gray area!). If we had more time on this project, we could fix this issue by calibrating the sensitivity of the car's sensors to be even greater. <p/>

                                            <p><br>Overall, I really enjoyed the hands-on aspect of soldering and so far, it has been my favorite part of the class! It feels very rewarding to have built the circuit myself in a way that was time-consuming and required focus to achieve. I hope to do some more soldering projects in my future! <p/>
