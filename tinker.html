                                            <p><br>TinkerCad is one of many CAD tools used in 3D printing. It is relatively simple and intuitive to operate. It is aimed towards a younger, less experienced audience looking to get into 3D printing. I found that the software was straightforward and didn't require much learning. It was also easy to use just the trackpad on my laptop and get by. <p/>

                                            <p><br>This assignment asked us to remix, or combine, two existing designs. What I immediately thought of was the classic Petco logo from our childhood, the one with the cat and dog sitting side by side, the dogs ear in between the two ears of the cat (shown to the right). <p/>

                                            So after sketching my design, I went onto old trusty thangs.com to start finding designs I could remix. However there wasn't many available that I was looking for, at least not those that were free to download. Ultimately, after finding a cat design that I liked, I realized I had to switch up what I was doing due to the limitations of my knowledge and constraints of the assignment. I had a new idea of remixing the cat design that I found with a bird sitting on top of its back. After finding a suitable bird design, I sketched my vision out. The thought process behind my design is shown to the right. <p/>

                                            Importing the two STL files into TinkerCad, I combined the cat and bird quite easily. The scaling method was straightforward, and it was easy to select both objects in order to combine them. My design setup in TinkerCad is shown to the right. After I was satisfied with my TinkerCad design, I exported the data in the form of a 3mf file and opened PrusaSlicer. <p/>

                                            <p><br>When I first imported the STL file into PrusaSlicer, I immediately got warnings about overhangs and the need for the support. This was the result of the tail piece, which originally hung over the printer bed without any place of attachment. Therefore, I turned on organic supports and sliced the design, and found it to look much more stable (and the warning went away). I kept the default measurements shown on the sidebar in the image to the right because they sounded reasonable to me. Exporting the G-Code onto a flash drive, I was then ready to print. <p/>

I would call this print somewhat successful. It definitely is not perfect by any means, but you can definitely see the vision. Some areas that need some workshopping are the rafts/supports, as all four of the cat’s feet and the tail broke off from the print. Speaking of the cat’s tail, it seems like it may have undergone a layer shift, as it is not one cohesive component, rather segmented in different sections. Additionally, there is a great amount of stringing on the sides and top of the print. Finally, while this is a nonessential detail, the print is also a little small, and I think it would look better if it had larger dimensions. <p/>

                                            <p><br>In conclusion, TinkerCad is a very user-friendly CAD tool that got the job done. Going forward and using Fusion for my next print, I want to improve on my current design, as I remix it in Fusion then set it up on PrusaSlicer. My main goals include making sure the feet and tail of the cat remain attached to the rest of the print by adding a full raft and more support for the tail, as well as increasing the size of the overall print by altering its dimensions. These changes will occur in PrusaSlicer, so for Fusion, I will just need to get used to operating the software. Feel free to check out how my Fusion print went back in the Intro to Computer Aided Design tab! <p/>
